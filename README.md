###  FAQ: Domino 9.0 / Domino 9.0.1 Install on Windows 2012 Service Won't Start Domino Server Issues Troubleshooting, Server Console ?
### Issue:
  After installing the 64-bit Domino server on Windows 64-bit 2012, you run into a problem starting IBM Domino. You can 
  start Domino from the command line, as an application, but starting as a Service doesn't work. You get a message that Domino started and stopped.

###  Solution:
   Perform both of the following:
   A: Update local hosts file
   If the Domino server's internal name is not part of DNS or it is behind a firewall so that the DNS resolved isn't the 
   right IP, then Domino won't start.
-  1. Edit the hosts file, at c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.
-  2. Add the IP of the server, with the FQDN on the server doc, also add the HTTP alias(es), as well, as needed.
  e.g. 192.168.100.85 dominolotus.cloud.edu.vn
-  3. Save the file.
   B. Verify the ServerController = 1 setting is set in the notes.ini.
-  1. Edit the notes.ini file (e.g. d:\lotus\domino\notes.ini).
-  2. Do a find to locate the entry.
-  3. Change from 0 to 1, if the value is not already a 1.
   C: Add the TCPIP_ControllerTcpIpAddress entry to the notes.ini specifying the Controller address.
-  1. Edit the notes.ini file (e.g. d:\lotus\domino\notes.ini).
-  2. Do a find to locate the entry.
-  a. If the entry exists, update it or clear the value to the right of the equal (=) sign.
  TCPIP_ControllerTcpIpAddress=192.168.100.85, or just TCPIP_ControllerTcpIpAddress=
-  b. If the entry doesn't exist, add it like below: TCPIP_ControllerTcpIpAddress=
-  3. Save the file.
   D. Verify the Windows Firewall has port 2050 open.
   
###  Note: 
    It's a good time to also verify that ports 1352, 80, and 443 are open, since you probably are doing both Notes and ###  web apps.
    Control Panel --> Security (This option varies) --> Windows Firewall --> Advanced Settings --> Incoming Ports.

- Using 64-bit NotesSQL to connect to a Remote Domino Server:
( Applies to: HCL Domino Server 9.0.X, 10.0.X, 11.0.X, 12.0)

###  8. Steps to create a data source entry:
1. Open the ODBC Datasource Manager 64-bit
2. Create a datasource using the NotesSQL driver
3. Put the datasource name and description
4. Type the name of the remote server in the 'Domino Server' field
5. The list of the databases should show up in the 'Database' field
After you've created a data source for the remote server successfully , you can shutdown the local domino server.
NOTE: You can use the ODBCTest 64-bit tool to test the connection.
